What is Systemcoin?
----------------

Systemcoin is a lite version of Bitcoin using 17 rounds of hash as a proof-of-work algorithm.
 - Super secure hashing algorithm: 17 rounds of scientific hashing functions (blake, bmw, groestl, jh, keccak, skein, luffa, cubehash, shavite, simd, echo, hamsi, fugue, shabal, whirlpool, sha2big, haval 5-pass)
 - Block reward is controlled by moore's law: 3333333/(((Difficulty+2600)/9)^2)
 - GPU/CPU only mining
 - Block generation: 60 seconds
 - Difficulty Retargets every block using Dark Gravity Wave
 - Est. ~7M Coins in 2015, ~13M in 2020, ~23M in 2030
 - Anonymous blockchain using DarkSend technology (Based on CoinJoin): Beta Testing

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Systemcoin client sofware, see http://www.Systemcoin.cf.

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Systemcoin
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
[mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=bitcoin-development).

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Systemcoin.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:

    cd src; make -f makefile.unix test

Unit tests for the GUI code are in `src/qt/test/`. To compile and run them:

    qmake BITCOIN_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test bitcoin-qt.pro
    make -f Makefile.test
    ./Systemcoin-qt_test




































QT-WALLET TESTS are currently under performing!!!!!!

## SYSTEMCOIN [STC]

SYSTEMCOIN (STC) is based on a stable system, design to withstand the demands of the entire altcoin community.

Our new algorithm is based on X15 POW + POS (After approx. 5 years we will be PoS).

This new algorithm is design to be adoptable for future applications. STC has a stable & fast system, with robust security capabilities.
